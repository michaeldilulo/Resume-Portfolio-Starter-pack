    "bio": "Hi there! I am Michael DiLulo, I attended a full stack developer boot camp through Boise Codeworks from November 2019 to February 2020. At Boise Codeworks I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js as the Front-End Framework, Node.js and C# on the backend, along with MongoDB and MySQL for databases. Since graduating I have also taken on learning React.js. I have a passion for helping others and spend my free time outdoors with my pup. I love to learn something new everyday, and have taken a deep interest in Cybersecurity as of late. I have served in the National Guard for 12 years, and love what I do, being there for the community when they are in need of assistance and comfort. Every year in March I take part in following the Iditarod Dog Sled Race. The event has such a great tradition and rich backstory. It would be a big dream accomplished to take part in such an event.",
